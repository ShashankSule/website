In recent years, machine learning techniques have penetrated a tremendous variety of scientific fields. In particular, they have given rise to data-driven methods for the study of rare event in complex physical systems such as conformational changes in biomolecules, rearrangements of clusters of interacting particles, etc. These methods truly opened new horizons by enabling us to address problems that used to be intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. They are divided into two families: diffusion map-based and neural network-based. In this RIT we will explore methods for the study of rare events based on machine learning.

Title: Finite expression method for solving high dimensional PDEs

Abstract: Designing efficient and accurate numerical solvers for high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a challenging and important topic in computational science and engineering, mainly due to the "curse of dimensionality" in designing numerical schemes that scale in dimension. I will introduce a new methodology that seeks an approximate PDE solution in the space of functions with finitely many analytic expressions, which is named the finite expression method (FEX). It is proved in approximation theory that FEX can avoid the curse of dimensionality. As a proof of concept, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to implement FEX for various high-dimensional PDEs in different dimensions, achieving high and even machine accuracy with a memory complexity polynomial in dimension and an amenable time complexity. An approximate solution with finite analytic expressions also provides interpretable insights into the ground truth PDE solution, which can further help to advance the understanding of physical systems and design postprocessing techniques for a refined solution.

## Program 

Each meeting, one of the participants will give a talk on a paper relevant to the subject of the RIT or on his/her research if it is related to ML or rare events.

## Registration 

There is an option for students to register for this RIT for one credit. In order to register, students need to contact Jessica Sadler (jsadler at umd dot edu), the AMSC program coordinator, and provide their UID. Students who has registered are expected to give a talk.
