In recent years, machine learning techniques have penetrated a tremendous variety of scientific fields. In particular, they have given rise to data-driven methods for the study of rare event in complex physical systems such as conformational changes in biomolecules, rearrangements of clusters of interacting particles, etc. These methods truly opened new horizons by enabling us to address problems that used to be intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. In this RIT we will explore methods for the study of rare events based on machine learning.

## Next Meeting

When/Where: Friday, February 10th, 2:00 pm, Kirwan Hall 1310. 

Speaker: Margot Yuan

<!-- Title: Approximating Noisy Nonlinear Oscillator Dynamics using Markov Chains

Abstract: Turbine blades in aircraft or energy harvesting windmills can be modeled as nonlinear oscillators driven by a periodic force and subject to noisy perturbations. These systems exhibit behavior where the individual blades experience oscillations that are sometimes very large in amplitude which can be detrimental. By understanding the dynamics of these stochastic systems we can transition them from a high amplitude oscillation to a low amplitude oscillation. In this talk I will discuss an approach using analog Markov chains to map out the state space and calculate the committer function and escape rate between high and low amplitude attractors. -->

## Program 

Each meeting, one of the participants will give a talk on a paper relevant to the subject of the RIT or on his/her research if it is related to ML or rare events.

## Registration 

There is an option for students to register for this RIT for one credit. In order to register, students need to contact Jessica Sadler (jsadler at umd dot edu), the AMSC program coordinator, and provide their UID. Students who has registered are expected to give a talk.
