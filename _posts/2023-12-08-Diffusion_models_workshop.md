I attended the [Measure Transport, Diffusion Processes and Sampling Workshop](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/measure-transport-diffusion-processes-and-sampling-workshop/)
at the Flatiron Institute! My [poster]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/files/research/TMD_maps__Poster_FFT_2023.pdf %}) featured new results on Target Measure Diffusion Maps (TMDmap), including a stability estimate for Dirichlet BVPs using TMDmaps and an application
to machine learning-based rare event quantification in the butane molecule.
