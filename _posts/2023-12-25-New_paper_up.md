'Tis the season to drop preprints! My work titled [Sharp error estimates for target measure diffusion maps with applications to the committor problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14418) with Dr. Maria Cameron and Luke Evans is submitted and up on arXiv. This paper is about leveraging the approximation theory of diffusion maps to gain concrete speedups in accuracy for applications in molecular dynamics.

<!--- Our work does an analysis of TMDmap along the lines of consistency of graph Laplacians and builds on this theory by computing the explicit prefactors in the leading order terms. Crucially, we find that some of these prefactors zero out in a highly important application: when the TMDmap is used to quantify rare events via the committor problem from transition path theory. Additionally, we also show that quasi-uniform sampling also tends to zero out prefactors, setting up an nice interplay between 
uniform sampling, density estimation, and diffusion maps. --->
