'Tis the season to drop preprints! My work titled [Sharp error estimates for target measure diffusion maps with applications to the committor problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14418) 
with Dr. Maria Cameron and Luke Evans is submitted and up on arXiv. This paper is concerned with the numerical analysis of kernel-based methods, and in particular the [Target Measure Diffusion Map (TMDmap)]
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063520318301222?casa_token=QqYbdvN-16sAAAAA:V34hSO1HtB6NFju-0C65Fla3vSIPJ-vIy6NL5VmiDvLrrjKaLxZwmNYCeF6klwq3YKboGcc2Ag) algorithm which combines 
diffusion maps with importance sampling. Our work does an analysis of TMDmap along the lines of consistency of graph Laplacians and builds on this theory by computing the explicit 
prefactors in the leading order terms. Crucially, we find that some of these prefactors zero out in a highly important application: when the TMDmap is used to quantify rare events via the committor problem 
from transition path theory. Additionally, we also show that quasi-uniform sampling also tends to zero out prefactors, setting up an nice interplay between 
uniform sampling, density estimation, and diffusion maps.
